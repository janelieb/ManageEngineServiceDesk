# ManageEngine
Create time-entry shortcuts list per technician for easier daily time keeping

1. VisualStudio Python connection to ServiceDesk database using Windows Authentication (requires connection permissions to service desk db)

2. Pull all relevant ManageEngine info per user. Ideally this will be either a setting grabbed by the person executing the code or it will read the user info and use that to match against the query on ServiceDesk (read only operations. Requires research into ability to read windows user)

3. Create a form with a background storage system to use to keep track of time entered outside the ticketing system to be entered later and shows usable links to the ManageEngine system to get time entry in correctly.  (read only operations)

4. Potential Feature: a push-to-servicedesk to record all of that week's recorded time? Might be a permissions nightmare.
